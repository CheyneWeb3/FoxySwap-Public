  "description": "90s/Y2K-inspired atmospheric rollerz and breakz for your mind and soul.\n\nThis is NOT AI music. These tunes were built the old way: hardware samplers, synths, mixers, dusty DAWs and a cassette deck. Many of the tracks were arranged in Renoise, bounced through outboard mixers, and the full session was recorded straight to tape.\n\nFull cassette tracklist:\n00:00:00 — delta waves\n00:08:00 — crystal stasis\n00:16:11 — synaptic transfer\n00:23:58 — oblivion\n00:28:17 — the amulet\n00:33:10 — monsoon\n00:35:35 — searcher\n00:43:53 — three days later\n00:52:25 — symmetry beyond\n00:59:05 — visual memory unit\n01:04:56 — the city at night (outro)\n\nProduction notes:\n• delta waves — renoise + korg modwave\n  Deep-stage IV sleep brainwaves translated into rolling breaks and low-frequency drift.\n\n• crystal stasis — renoise\n  Named after the crystalized fate of a l’Cie in Final Fantasy XIII — frozen in time between focus and oblivion.\n\n• synaptic transfer — renoise + soundtracs topaz 14-4\n  Shared dreamlines and cross-wired memories; think experimental neuroscience, LSD, and fringe sci-fi.\n\n• oblivion — polyend tracker\n  A timeless drift into the void; tracker grooves carved directly into a cassette haze.\n\n• the amulet — roland sp-808\n  A relic that opens portals and tears in space — the Eye of Hades patched through vinyl-style FX.\n\n• monsoon — renoise + korg opsix\n  Arizona dust storms, beautiful and dangerous — harmonic FM textures over thick atmospheric pressure.\n\n• searcher — renoise + soundcraft spirit 12\n  Always hunting the ultimate ride; a bodhisattva on the breaks, delaying nirvana to bring others along.\n\n• three days later — renoise + soundtracs topaz 14-4\n  A title card flickers: “Three Days Later”. Max Cherry, Jackie Brown, late-night plans and quiet tension.\n\n• symmetry beyond — ibook g3 + logic 4 / exs24\n  Patterns that loop, reflect and rotate — hinting at something just past perfect symmetry.\n\n• visual memory unit — renoise + mackie 1202\n  A Sega Dreamcast VMU glitching in the corner of your eye, saving fragments of lives and high scores.\n\n• the city at night (outro) — renoise\n  When the city finally goes quiet, you can hear the concrete nature breathing.\n\nSome of these tracks can also be found on [OMNI139] Arcologies — Symmetry Beyond, but this NFT represents the full cassette-style session as heard on the YouTube upload.",
